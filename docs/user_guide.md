## Advanced Features Guide

### Configuring the Anomaly Detector

The anomaly detection system can be customized with several parameters:

- **Z-score threshold**: Sensitivity of the detector (default: 2.5)
- **Window size**: For moving average calculations (default: 20)
- **Volume change threshold**: For volume spike detection (default: 200%)
- **Volatility threshold**: For volatility anomalies (default: 2.0)

### Using Pattern Recognition

Pattern recognition works best with the following guidelines:

- **Minimum data points**: At least 100 data points recommended
- **Timeframe**: Daily or weekly timeframes yield better results than intraday
- **Confidence threshold**: Consider patterns with confidence > 0.6 as significant

### Network Graph Interpretation

The stock relationship network visualizes connections between stocks:

- **Node size**: Represents market cap or trading volume
- **Edge thickness**: Represents correlation strength
- **Clusters**: Stocks that tend to move together

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use appropriate timeframes**: Longer timeframes provide more reliable signals for long-term analysis
2. **Combine multiple indicators**: Don't rely on a single indicator for trading decisions
3. **Verify patterns**: Use pattern recognition as a starting point, but verify with additional analysis
4. **Filter snapshot data**: Use filters to focus on relevant market segments for more meaningful analysis
5. **Export valuable insights**: Use the export functionality to save important findings
